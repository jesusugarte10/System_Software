make sure your source file is named vm.c and takes the input file name as a command line argument
you should be able to run it with something like $ ./a.out test7.txt

copy both test files, both output files, tester.sh, and vm.c to the same folder
you should run this program on eustis

once all the files are in the same directory, simply run the command $ bash tester.sh

the program will indicate if your implementation is passing the test cases.

if you have any questions, please contact ta Noelle at noellemidkiff@knights.ucf.edu
